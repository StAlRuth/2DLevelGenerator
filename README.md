Extensible (one day) 2D Tiled Level Generator
=============================================

This program was once a maze generator exclusively, but it can use any algorithm that can create a 2D level with only walls, a starting point and stairs.

In the future, maze/level generators will be changeable in-app, and I'll add a Python interface so that people can add their own generators.

Maze Generation Algorithms Implemented:
- Modified Kruskal's Algorithm

Other Level Generation Algorithms implemented:
- An empty room with a starting point and stairs.

Note that in this game, the player is BLUE, the stairs are GREEN, and walls are RED.
Arrow keys move the player, reach the stairs to generate another level.
