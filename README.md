The A-Maze-ing Game
===================
(I know the pun is terrible, I couldn't resist)

"The A-Maze-ing Game" is not so much a game (although it can function as one)
as a collection of maze creating algorithms with a renderer and game tacked on.

In the future, maze generators will be changeable, and the solve function
will actually be implemented.  One day.

Maze Generation Algorithms Implemented:
- Kruskal's Algorithm
