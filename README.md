The A-Maze-ing Game
===================
(I know the pun is terrible, I couldn't resist)

This is a program that not only generates mazes that can be solved, it can also create dungeons and other kinds of 2D level...

If the area of the "Maze" was big enough.

In the future, maze/level generators will be changeable in-app.

Maze Generation Algorithms Implemented:
- Modified Kruskal's Algorithm

Other Level Generation Algorithms implemented:
- It's a room with a starting point and some stairs
